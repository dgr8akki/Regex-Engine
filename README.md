# Regex-Engine
This is a regex engine build beautifully in core Javascript.

Beautiful code is likely to be simple -- clear and easy to understand. Beautitful code is likely to be compact -- just enough code to do the job and no more -- but not cryptic, to the point where it cannot be understood. Beautiful code may well be general, solving a broad class of problems in a uniform way. One might even describe it as elegant, showing good taste and refinement.

Regular expressions are a notation for describing patterns of text, in effect a special-purpose language for pattern matching. Although there are many variants, all share the idea that most characters in a pattern match literal occurrences of themselves but some "metacharacters" have special meaning, for example "*" to indicate some kind of repetition or [...] to mean any one character from the set within the brackets.

## What is Regular Expression?

> Regular expression is a group of characters or symbols which is used to find a specific pattern from a text.

A regular expression is a pattern that is matched against a subject string from
left to right. The word "Regular expression" is a mouthful, you will usually
find the term abbreviated as "regex" or "regexp". Regular expression is used for
replacing a text within a string, validating form, extract a substring from a
string based upon a pattern match, and so much more.

Imagine you are writing an application and you want to set the rules for when a
user chooses their username. We want to allow the username to contain letters,
numbers, underscores and hyphens. We also want to limit the number of characters
in username so it does not look ugly. These all purposes are served by Regular
Expressions a.k.a Regex.
